      <p>I'm a tech PM with 7 years of experience. I love to build stuff, most recently at LinkedIn where I worked on ads. Before LinkedIn, I worked at a startup called Quixey.</p>
      <p>When I'm not building, you can find me outdoors, listening to music, cooking+eating new stuff, experimenting with DIY furniture, or learning something new.</p>
      <p>I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley and currently living in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
      <p>I'm currently on a career break to take some time to reflect on what I want to do next. If there's an opportunity you think I'd be excited about, feel free to <a href= "mailto:gmark131@gmail.com">contact me.</a></p>
